      <nDrive> The number of the drive you are requesting info on where 1 = A,

      drive.  The default is 0

      free space on the current drive that is available to the user
      requesting the information.

      zh_DiskSpace( [<cDrive>] [, <nType>] ) --> nDiskBytes
   $ARGUMENTS$
      <cDrive> The drive letter you are requesting info on. The default
      is A:

      <nType> The type of space being requested. The default is ZH_DISK_AVAIL.
   $RETURNS$
      <nDiskBytes> The number of bytes on the requested disk that match the
      requested type.
   $DESCRIPTION$
      By default, this function will return the number of bytes of
      free space on the current drive that is available to the user
      requesting the information.

      There are 4 types of information available:

       ZH_DISK_AVAIL  The amount of space available to the user making the
                      request. This value could be less than ZH_FS_FREE if
                      disk quotas are supported by the O/S in use at runtime,
                      and disk quotas are in effect. Otherwise, the value
                      will be equal to that returned for ZH_FS_FREE.

       ZH_DISK_FREE   The actual amount of free disk space on the drive.

       ZH_DISK_USED   The number of bytes in use on the disk.

       ZH_DISK_TOTAL  The total amount of space allocated for the user if
                      disk quotas are in effect, otherwise, the actual size
                      of the drive.

      If information is requested on a disk that is not available, a runtime
      error 2018 will be raised.
