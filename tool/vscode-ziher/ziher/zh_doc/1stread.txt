   $DESCRIPTION$
      
      Ziher is a free software compiler for the xBase superset language often
      referred to as Clipper (the language that is implemented by the compiler
      Clipper). The goal of Ziher is to produce a cross platform CA-Cl*pper
      compatible compiler.

      If you are reading this file as part of a source distribution of Ziher you
      probably want to start by reading doc/dirstruc.txt because this is your map to
      the Ziher source directories.

      Ziher is a superset of Clipper and is backwards compatible with nearly
      100% of all Clipper 5.2x or 5.3 code. Most Clipper S'87 code will also
      compile and run fine, but may require some modifications to run well.
