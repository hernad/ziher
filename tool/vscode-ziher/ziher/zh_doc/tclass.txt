      ZHClass() is used in the creation of all classes

      oClass := ZHClass():New( "TMyClass" )

        -or-

      ZHClass() is usually accessed by defining a class with the commands
      defined in hbclass.ch:

      CREATE CLASS ZHGetList  // Calls ZHClass() to create the ZHGetList class
         ...
      ENDCLASS
   $ARGUMENTS$

   $RETURNS$
      An instance of the ZHClass() Class. This special object's `:New()`
      method can then create the classes you define.
   $DESCRIPTION$

      The class methods are as follows:

      `:New()`              Create a new instance of the class

      Object Oriented syntax in Ziher is compatible with CA-Cl*pper.

      However CA-Cl*pper only allowed creation of objects from a few standard
      classes, and did not let the programmer create new classes.

      In Ziher, you can create your own classes--complete with
      Methods, Instance Variables, Class Variables and Inheritance.
      Entire applications can be designed and coded in Object Oriented
      style.
