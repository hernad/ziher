   If accented characters need special sorting ( ZH_CDP_ACSORT_EQUAL or
   ZH_CDP_ACSORT_INTERLEAVE ) then you need to mark the accented characters
   with the symbol '~' before each of them, for example:
      a~Ã‡
   If there is two-character sequence, which is considered as one, it should
   be marked with '.' before and after it, for example:
      ... h.ch.i ...
   if such multibyte character has its own Unicode representation then
   this Unicode value can be set using '=' symbol, for example:
      ....h.ch=2A7C.i
   and it will be used in translations.

   The Upper case string and the Lower case string should use the same
   letters. If some characters does not have corresponding upper or lower
   letter then space ' ' can be used as dummy character, for example in
   German CPs there is no upper case 'scharfes S' letter so space is used
   as dummy character.

   otherwise 0
